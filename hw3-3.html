          In this version of Blackjack, the player always deals three cards.
          When the "Hit" button is clicked, the page should be updated replacing
          the three cards with three random cards facing up. The card images for
          each value/shape are inside <em>'images/cards'</em> folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          When player's hand (the sum of three cards' values) exceeds 21, the
          paragraph above "Hit" button (currently showing "RESULT") should show
          "<strong>You are Busted!</strong>", otherwise it should show "<strong
            >You are Not Busted!</strong
          >".
        </li>
        <li>
          The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10).
          Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth <strong>10</strong>.
          To simplify this game, <strong>Ace is always worth 1</strong>.
