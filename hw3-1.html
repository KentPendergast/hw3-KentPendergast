      <ol>
        <li>
          Display image of the player corresponding to the button the user
          clicks on.

        <li>
          Change the color of the image border based on the button displayed:
          yellow for Al, red for Jaylen, green for Jayson and lime for Payton.
          If my color choices are poor, you can pick your own colors as long as
          it is different and unique for each image.
        </li>
        <li>
          Change the heading, "Celtics Player's Name Goes Here" to the name of
          player shown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Change the background color of the button that the user clicks on to
          Silver. Only the button the user has clicked on must be Silver. All
          others must be White.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enlarge the image by 25% when the user mouses-over it and return it to
          normal size when the user mouses-out of the image.
        </li>
        <li>
          (Optional) Try <code>Array</code> and <code>for</code>, loop so only one function is needed for 1-4.
